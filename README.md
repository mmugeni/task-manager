Many task management tools are complicated and hard to set up, so this project creates a simple task app that runs directly in a web browser. It helps users stay organized without needing technical knowledge or a database. The app works on phones, tablets, and computers, allowing users to add tasks, mark them as complete, delete them, and filter between active and completed items. It also shows how many tasks are left and saves everything in the browser using localStorage, so tasks remain even after refreshing or closing the page.

The app was built using HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity, and it is hosted online using GitHub Pages. Behind the scenes, the browser requests the website files from GitHub’s servers through DNS and HTTP, then displays the app. All data stays on the user’s device, making it fast and private.

how it works;
Enter task and add it to the list, you have the option to view all your tasks you just the complete or the incomplete one then at any point you can delete the tasks.
